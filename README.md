GHTV Reloaded Hyperspeed Text Parser

This is just me testing how to parse a XML file for the video game Guitar Hero Live.
In Guitar Hero Live there was a mode called GHTV.
GHTV was shut down.
Now there's a new custom server and update to the game that can run either on RPCS3 or Wii U (as of the time typing this README).
The new custom server is called GHTV Reloaded.

As of right now, in order to change "Hyperspeed" in the game, the speed at which the highawy is going at in game, you would have to modify each TRACK file for every song in GHTV Reloaded.
This is a tool to scan, read, parse, and modify those files with user input to how much they want to increase the speed of the highway by.
Input of -100 makes it 0% and input of 100 makes it 200%.
This is just a test to see that it works, and yes it does.

The data used in this program may be outdated as more custom songs and unreleased songs are added to the game.
Guitar Hero is not dead!
